# Prefer the host WebKitGTK over the bundled one when the host has a complete
# stack of its own. Sourced from AppRun before linuxdeploy's own GTK hook.
#
# The AppImage carries the WebKitGTK it was built against. That build happens
# on ubuntu-22.04 so the binary links the oldest glibc we support, which also
# means the bundle ships a 2022 WebKit. On distros whose Mesa has moved on -
# Arch, CachyOS, Fedora - that WebKit cannot create an EGL display. Both of its
# helper processes abort with
#
#   Could not create default EGL display: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER. Aborting...
#
# the main process survives, and splash.rs's fallback timer then reveals a main
# window that never painted. That is the white screen of issues #25 and #28.
# None of the usual WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER / WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE
# workarounds help, because the failure is in EGL display creation itself and
# happens before any renderer choice is made.
#
# So when the host has its own webkit2gtk-4.1 and the GTK stack that goes with
# it, run against that instead. It is what the .deb already does and the only
# configuration a rolling distro actually tests. Hosts without it - the older
# distros the bundle exists for in the first place - are untouched and keep
# using the bundled stack.
#
# OSG_APPIMAGE_STACK=host or =bundled forces one path and skips the probe.
